## OCaml network conduit library

The `conduit` library takes care of establishing and listening for 
TCP and SSL/TLS connections for the Lwt and Async libraries.

The reason this library exists is to provide a degree of abstraction
from the precise SSL library used, since there are a variety of ways
to bind to a library (e.g. the C FFI, or the Ctypes library), as well
as well as which library is used (just OpenSSL for now).

###Â Modules

Source code is in `lib/`.

* `Conduit_lwt` has the Lwt UNIX modules.
