The {!Conduit} library abstracts the concerns of establishing connections to
peers that may be running within the same host (e.g. in another virtual
machine) or on a remote host via TCP.  It consists of:

- The {!Conduit} module with basic type definitions
- Modules for {{!transport}establishing individual connections}
- Modules for {{!resolution}name resolvers} that maps URIs to endpoints

{2:transport Connection Establishment} 

Connections are created by identifying remote nodes using an
{{!Conduit.endp}endp} value.  To ensure portability, the
{{!Conduit.endp}endpoints} are translated into concrete connections by separate
modules that target [Lwt_unix], [Async] and [Mirage].  This lets those backends
use the appropriate local technique for creating the connection (such as using
OpenSSL on Unix, or a pure OCaml TLS+TCP implementation on Mirage, or some
other combination).

The modules dealing with connection establishment are:
{!modules: Conduit_lwt_unix Conduit_async Conduit_mirage}

{2:resolution Name Resolution}

This deals with resolving URIs into a list of {{!Conduit.endp}endp} addresses that can
then be connected to by the {{!transport}connection establishment} modules.

All of the name resolvers conform to the {!Conduit.RESOLVER} module type.
The OS-specific implementations of this interface are: 
{!modules: Conduit_resolver_lwt Conduit_resolver_lwt_unix Conduit_resolver_mirage}
